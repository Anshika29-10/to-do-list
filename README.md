# To-Do List (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## What it does:
A simple To-Do list web app that lets users:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed (with a check)
- Delete tasks
- Saves tasks to browser's localStorage, so they persist after refresh

##  What I learned:
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Event handling for user interactions
- Saving and loading data using `localStorage`
- Building responsive UI using CSS Flexbox and gradients

## üß© Challenges I faced:
- ‚ùå I mistakenly wrote `cick` instead of `onclick` in the HTML button tag, which prevented the `addTask()` function from triggering. I was debugging the JavaScript code for a long time before realizing it was a typo in HTML.
- ‚ùå Tasks were showing up by default because I had hardcoded `<li>` elements in the HTML. I removed them and let JavaScript handle everything dynamically.
- ‚úÖ Learned to inspect the DOM and use browser dev tools to trace such issues effectively.
